# Delay-StartUp

```
Delay-StartUp allows you to add programs here and have greater control than you will get out of windows itself. Config options should be explained in the json file. Update: Now the first testing version of the Delay Settings Manager is in the folder. DelaySM.ps1, Fixed countdown char. placement. _Update_: Finalized the json style completed all scripts Version 1 released. _Update_: I improved the Delay Settings manager by cleaning up console window positioning as it runs. Added more options, mainly Verify and Test run. Verify will end up being something that runs auto every time you edit or add. _Update_: Added a TestRun setting that can be set to run the script without actually executing the exe's so you can test changes.
