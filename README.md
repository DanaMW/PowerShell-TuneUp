# PowerShell-TuneUp
```
PowerShell Scripts and snips for the learning curve.
All are working in Powershell Code 6.0.X unless they say otherwise.
If you have improvements to them please share them with me, thats what this is about for me.
Hope they help someone else. Enjoy.

# BinMenu
```
Bin Menu is a simple console based menu that reads in what exe's are in the sub-folders and which
*PS1's are in it and lists them on a menu for you.
```
# ScriptConverter
```
That is my CSS to JS converter for use on Tampermonkey and Edge browser. Very simply,
it copies over most of the header to UserScript amnd puts quotes outside of the script.
```
# Imageto64
```
Feed it a filename of a image file and it feeds you back the base64 info ready to put into
your script files.
```
# Clearlogs
```
This clears most to all of your windows logs for you.
