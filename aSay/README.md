# ASAY and NOTIFY

</p align=center></a>ASAY and NOTIFY are really the same file. They will send a notification to the standard windows notification center. I use it in my scripts to let me know when any event has happened I might want to see. The format is simple, without quote ASAY [any text you want to send to the notify]</p></a>
