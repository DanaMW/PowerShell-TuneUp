# BinMenu

BinMenu is my answerto not being able to find a PowerShell menu tht worked for me. I keep all my portable software in one folder. (C:\bin) Well i needed a menu that reads it in event when the software changes. THis is a first draft and is working on my machines with PowerShell Core 6.0.3. it Also will in the next release read in my scripts that are stored in that folder.


To use it open BinMenu.ps1 and uncomment the "Break" (Comments show you were then save and run it. The file it creates you then edit. Take out the lines of the programs that YOU WANT. NOTE Leave in the programs you DONT WANT. Save that file as BinMenu.csv.
Then edit BinMenu.ps1 And recomment the BREAK that you uncommented and save. Rerun BinMenu and there you are.. a custom menu with your current exe programs.
