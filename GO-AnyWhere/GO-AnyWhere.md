## Get-Files
```
Just a simple little routine to get a directory listing in color.
```
## The [[[GO]-]Anywhere] Group
```
This little group of scripts is my way for getting around in the console. You can
enter folder names as follows: GO-FOLDER or GO FOLDER and if it is a repo folder
you can add the third parameter GO-MAINREPO REPONAME or GO MAINREPO REPONAME.
then because I wanted to stick with this simple short setup you can also use it
just like Set-Location. GO .. or GO D:\Downloads or GO ROOT D or GO "\\MACHINENAME\SHAREDFOLDER"
```
